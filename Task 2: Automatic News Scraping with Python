            "A think tank has blamed \"woeful budgeting\" at the Home Office for repeated overspending on asylum support. Over the last three years, the department's initial budgets for spending on asylum, border, visa and passport operations amounted to £320m. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it had ended up spending £7.9bn over the period, £7.6bn more than forecasted. The IFS also warned the department had submitted figures it \"knows to be insufficient\" for this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Government departments submit estimated spending to Parliament up to four times a year, so that MPs can approve the use of public money in advance. According to Treasury guidance, departments must ensure their estimates are \"consistent with their best forecasts of requirements\", which the IFS report says \"certainly does not appear to be the case\" for the Home Office. IFS research economist Max Warner said estimates should not be \"unrealistically low\" and fail to identify spending \"that the government knows will occur but does not want to budget for\". \"There is a strong case that the current budgeting process is failing for asylum spending,\" he said. He added that the Home Office had got into a \"bad habit of submitting initial budgets to parliament that it knows to be insufficient\", expecting the Treasury to top this up from reserves later in the financial year - as happened last year, when its asylum budget was topped up by more than £4bn. He said: \"When there is a one-off unexpected spike in costs or demand, spending more than was budgeted is entirely understandable. \"But when it is happening year after year, something is going wrong with the budgeting process.\" The department's budgeting has also been repeatedly criticised by the Commons home affairs select committee.\n",

Robert Telles, 47, has been jailed since 2022 for the stabbing of Las Vegas Review-Journal investigative journalist Jeff German. During trial, prosecutors presented the jury with DNA evidence found under Mr German's fingernails that they said belonged to Telles - who had pleaded not guilty. A jury of 12 returned a guilty verdict on Wednesday, after deliberating for two days. Several hours later, the same jury sentenced Telles to life in prison.\n",

Telles was given a life sentence in a separate hearing later on Wednesday. He is eligible for parole after he serves 20 years in prison. The seven women and five men that composed the jury deliberated for roughly 12 hours, beginning on Monday, before the panel reached its conclusion. The trial had stretched across two weeks. Testimony in court came from dozens of witnesses, including detectives, forensic experts, those who knew the ex-politician, and Telles himself. He alleged that he had been framed. “This thing has been kind of a nightmare,” he said about a week into the trial. “I want to say unequivocally - I’m innocent. I didn’t kill Mr German.\" In September 2022, Mr German, 69, was found after he had been stabbed seven times in the neck and torso outside his Nevada home.\n",

A rise in cases of the highly spreadable measles virus, which can be very serious in some children, is feared when the new term starts. Uptake of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, has improved in many areas since a spate of outbreaks last year - but health experts say there is still ground to make up. Children can also be protected against other serious diseases, such as whooping cough, meningitis, diptheria and polio.\n",

NHS National vaccinations and screening director Steve Russell said measles clearly \"can be really dangerous\" and it was \"critical\" children were vaccinated. Major measles outbreaks in England in the past year, in London, the West Midlands and the North West, sparked a campaign for parents to catch up on missed jabs. Two MMR jabs offer the best and safest protection against measles. One is offered at the age of one, a second at three years and four months, as part of the NHS routine childhood-vaccination programme.\n",

            "Since the campaign, NHS England says, thousands more young people are protected, with more than 13% of previously unvaccinated under-fives having a jab. But by March, only 92% of under-sixes in England had had their first MMR jab and 83% their second - the target is 95%. Latest figures for Scotland and Wales show they met the target.

The Department for Education (DfE) says the review will support BTec students - but the results are not due until December. And the lack of clarity has left schools and colleges unsure which courses they can offer prospective students in 2025, despite many having open days scheduled in the coming weeks.\n",

But days before the first changes to funding were due, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the new Labour government would \"pause and review\" the plans. And no final decision will be made until the end of the year at the earliest - less than 12 months before schools and colleges welcome new students in September 2025. In response, 455 schools and colleges in England have joined the Protect Student Choice campaign, a coalition of 25 education organisations and unions. They educate about a third of all 16- to 19-year-olds. In a letter to Ms Phillipson, they have asked for more clarity on the future of applied general qualifications (AGQs), such as BTecs. And they want the pause to be extended by a further year \"to ensure that young people are not disadvantaged by your proposed reforms\". The DfE said it had taken “immediate action” to pause the proposed defunding before the start of August - and the continuing review would “bring certainty to the sector”.\n",

            "Ambulance crews are wasting “significant” amounts of time being called out unnecessarily to prisons across England, the health safety watchdog has said. One NHS trust told investigators it dealt with 5,000 calls to 999 from prison staff across its region in 2023. Overall the research found that almost three in four calls from prisons did not need an ambulance response, compared with one in eight calls from the general population. The Department of Health said it was “essential” that an ambulance was called only when there was a serious concern about the health of the prisoner.\n",
            "\n",
            "On one occasion, several crews, including an air ambulance, were dispatched to an “unresponsive” inmate who was thought to be unconscious, the watchdog said. On arrival they found the patient was simply refusing to answer questions. One anonymous paramedic told investigators that “we waste vital time driving to a prison for a call which then gets cancelled, and we’ve just added that time on to the response to someone who [really] needs us”.\n",

            "Afraid of being blamed\n",
            "\n",
            "The report by the Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) found that prisons often encouraged a “low-risk response” when inmates were injured or fell ill. Some prison control rooms were told to call 999 immediately and then wait for an on-site nurse to examine the patient, and then stand down the ambulance if it was not needed. High turnover and a lack of training meant that prison staff first on the scene of a medical emergency tended to be inexperienced. Some staff told the watchdog they were afraid of having to attend a coroner’s court or being blamed for making a wrong decision if they did not call 999. “You end up with a system that doesn't work for anybody,” said the HSSIB’s senior investigator Dave Fassam. \"It's putting pressure on prison staff who are very busy... and paramedics who don't want to be called to a scenario that doesn't warrant them being there.\" The watchdog was told that the volume of emergency calls from prisons was now having a knock-on effect on the wider community, with paramedics and call handlers left frustrated after ambulances were diverted from other jobs unnecessarily. It said communication between prison staff and the emergency services needed to improve significantly, with crews sometimes dispatched to a prison with the wrong information. In one case, paramedics had been told they were going to treat a patient in his 90s with a twisted ankle. When they arrived they found a man in his 30s with several stab wounds.\n",

            "\n",
            "A deaf world championship swimmer has said she \"can't wait\" to hear the crowds for the first time at the Paris Paralympics. A rule change in 2023 means Suzanna Hext, from Calne in Wiltshire, can wear her cochlear implants during her race. Ms Hext, who was born with a hearing impairment and is now profoundly deaf, will be competing in the S5 100m freestyle. \"Having that crowd and that feel of the atmosphere, it's got to give you a buzz to get down that pool pretty quick,\" said Ms Hext, who was left paralysed from the waist down after a \"freak accident\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Cochlear implants are an option for children and adults who are not helped by hearing aids. Unlike hearing aids, which make sounds louder, cochlear implants work by turning sound into electrical signals and sending them to part of the inner ear called the cochlea.\n",

Ms Hext was also unwell during her first Paralympics, so said the experience \"wasn't the best\". She added she was \"super excited\" for the Paralympic Games, which will take place between 28 August to 8 September. \"Obviously absolutely terrified as well, so it's a kind of mix of emotions,\" she said. As well as being able to hear the crowd's cheers, having the \"massive support\" of her friends and family there would make a \"huge difference\", she said. \"Emotionally, I wouldn't be where I am today without my family and my partner and friends. \"Its a team effort to get to this point,\" she added.\n",

She broke her pelvis, spinal cord, shoulder and suffered a brain injury. \"Before my accident, life in some ways slotted into place. Life felt pretty perfect,\" she told BBC Radio Somerset. But then her \"whole world fell apart\". She said it had changed the way she looked at life. \"It does make you treasure every moment that bit more. I feel very lucky to be here today. \"If you think of how far I've come from the day my parents got the phone call to say I'd had my accident... it's been a rollercoaster,\" she added.\n",

Looking ahead to the Paris Paralympics, the athlete said: \"I just want to fully immerse myself in the whole experience. \"Being around teammates, cheering each other on, that's a massive part of it. \"Obviously I'd love to win a medal, but if I come out of Paris giving it everything I've got and knowing that I put everything in that I can, then I'll be over the moon.\" In 2023, she won the Para Swimming World Championships in Manchester only days after recovering from respiratory illness related to her asthma that ended with her being admitted to a high-dependency hospital.\n",

            "\n",
            "Power is flowing from the Shetland Isles to mainland Britain for the first time as the UK's most productive onshore windfarm comes on stream. SSE says its 103-turbine project, known as Viking, can generate 443 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes. Shetland is the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the turbines not to be spinning. Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told BBC News a \"significant acceleration\" in renewable energy infrastructure is now urgently needed if the UK is to meet its climate change targets. \"We need to do a lot more of these projects, a lot more offshore wind projects as well, to make sure that we can decarbonise the energy system,\" he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "The chief executive of SSE Alistair Phillips-Davies said they plan to invest £20bn into renewables\n",
            "\n",
            "But critics of windfarms – and the pylons required to carry the electricity they generate – say a new era of mass industrialisation for private profit will ruin swathes of the British countryside. SSE has built a 160-mile long undersea cable to carry the power from Viking to Noss Head, near Wick, on the Scottish mainland. The company said it has invested more than £1bn in the windfarm and cable projects, and plans to plough another £20bn into renewables by the end of the decade. Mr Phillips-Davies said that would amount to \"the biggest construction that we've seen since the Second World War.\" \"Shetland's got a great wind resource. This is the first of the really big wind farms that may be built here. There'll be more projects to come,\" he said.\n",

            "'Crucial' to end fossil fuel reliance\n",
            "\n",
            "The UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Viking was \"a crucial part\" of reducing the UK's reliance on \"volatile fossil fuel markets, boosting our energy independence and protecting consumers.\" The Labour government has set a target for 100% of the UK's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030, phasing out gas-fired power stations. Ministers have promised to accelerate the development of wind, hydrogen and carbon capture projects by investing £8.3bn over five years in a publicly-owned power company called Great British Energy. The Conservatives have previously said that GB Energy is a \"financial black hole\" which will funnel taxpayers' money \"into reducing risk for multi-million pound energy companies.\" Mr Miliband also claims the Viking project will ensure \"hundreds of thousands of homes in the Shetlands and right across the country will benefit from cheap, homegrown energy,\" but that is hotly contested on the archipelago.\n",

            "Moraig Lyall from Shetland Islands Council said islanders often face higher bills\n",

            "Moraig Lyall, chair of the environment and transport committee of Shetland Islands Council, said annual household bills in the islands were often more than double the UK average of £1,700 and showed no sign of falling as a result of hosting Viking. \"People look out their windows now, they see all these turbines that are generating lots and lots of energy, but they're not seeing the benefit here. \"They're still sitting in their homes having to decide, can I afford to put on my heating, and so people are justifiably angry about that,\" she said, adding that islanders were also worried about Viking's impact on the landscape; the peat bog environment on which it was built; and tourism.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is concern on the mainland too, where some communities are objecting to plans by SSE and others to erect large pylons to transmit electricity from new renewable projects to cities and towns throughout Scotland, England and Wales. \"Somebody needs to police the line between net zero ideology and rampant commercial opportunism,\" said Kate Matthews of Save Our Mearns, a group campaigning against SSE's plans to install 37- 44 miles (60-70km) of new pylons from Kintore in Aberdeenshire to Tealing in Angus. \"Angus and Aberdeenshire are looking at 10 to 20 years of industrialisation, so constant building, constant applications, thousands of acres of battery energy storage, thousands of acres of solar turbine hydrogen plants,\" said Ms Matthews. \"We'll be paying the price for generations. It will be unrecognisable,\" she added. Ms Matthews said \"the rest of the UK doesn't know what's coming,\" with plans for new pylons in Essex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, the Lake District, parts of Wales, and elsewhere.\n",

            "The Viking windfarm is a new feature on the Shetland landscape\n",
            "\n",
            "Ministers have also pledged to reform planning laws to make it easier and quicker for big projects to gain consent. Mr Phillips-Davies of SSE said that was vital, pointing out that it took 20 years for Viking to go from inception to blades turning, 16 years of which were on paper. He is calling for both the UK and Scottish governments to streamline and accelerate their planning processes so projects can be approved or rejected within 12 months.

            "What’s the meaning of \"reset\"? That’s the question hanging over the prime minister’s visit to Berlin today. No one is denying that the mood music is good. Both centre-left leaders who entered office after long periods of conservative dominance, Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are comfortable in each other’s company. And while Sir Keir has been prime minister for less than two months, this was their fifth meeting - in part a quirk of the England football team getting to the final of the European Championships. This was their first formal meeting, though. It saw the prime minister use the \"reset\" word which has punctuated practically every interaction he has had with a European leader since entering office. But perhaps for the first time, it saw the prime minister begin the work of putting some meat on the bones of what a reset might look like. Both governments have committed to underscoring the Anglo-German relationship with a treaty. The low-key Mr Scholz was noticeably enthusiastic, saying that Germany intended to \"take this hand that has been reached out to us\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Two things are especially striking about the leaders’ professed ambitions for this treaty. One is how fast they plan to negotiate it: within six months. The other is how broad it is intended to be. In his press conference with Mr Scholz this morning, the prime minister suggested it would cover trade, defence, illegal migration, science, technology, development, people and culture. Downing Street’s formal announcement also referenced collaboration on energy, supply chains, biodiversity and the environment. Quite a lot, then. For some, that will prompt the question of whether the treaty’s intended breadth is a sign of how significant it is, or whether it shows that the treaty is merely a symbolic way of writing down the ways in which the countries already cooperate. There was one other eye-grabbing phrase in Downing Street’s announcement of the treaty. It said the \"ambitious agreement\" was designed to deepen \"market access\" in both directions.\n",

            "As is wearily familiar to the entire British political class after the tumultuous years of Brexit negotiations, there are clear and strict limits to the access a non-EU country can achieve into a specific EU member state’s markets. Government sources have suggested that this ambition is really about smoothing market access for UK firms trading in Germany (and vice versa), dealing with specific frictions related to certifications and tendering. The politics of all this could prove tricky for Sir Keir too. Having once been the shadow Brexit secretary who made his reputation in the Labour Party by pushing for another EU referendum, he prospered in last month's general election in part by reassuring 2019 Conservative voters that he would not undo Brexit. The prime minister reiterated that position today, insisting that the fundamental architecture of Britain’s post-Brexit settlement - outside the single market, outside the customs union - is not up for debate. That may disappoint others in Sir Keir’s electoral coalition who were hoping, despite his firm stance pre-election, for a shift in office.\n",

She says that they have instead learned from what they have read online. “If you can get ChatGPT to spit out something that looks like a recipe, then it's because there are recipes on the internet.” She adds that the AI could have grabbed the recipe from someone’s cookery blog, thereby decreasing their reader numbers, and their ability to make a living from subscriptions or advertising revenue. However, Prof Bender does concede that in the future more sophisticated AI may be helpful in recipe creation. She says that the AI could be asked to \"categorise ingredients as sweet, or acidic, and so on\", find those that the internet says should taste good together, and then come up with endless detailed recipes. \"However, you have to have a well-defined research question [to give the AI] to get that kind of benefit,\" she adds.\n",

They want the governments in England and Wales to publish strategies for returning beavers to their natural habitats and for “illegal” wild populations to be allowed to stay.

There are thought to be hundreds of wild beavers living “illegally” in English rivers and more than 1,000 in Scotland. This summer, beavers were born in enclosures from Ealing, west London, to the Wallington Estate, in Northumberland, on rivers in Canterbury, Kent, and at the Cairngorms, in the Highlands. Beavers were acknowledged as a native species in England in 2022, paving the way for reintroductions - but no strategy has been announced, despite a three-year consultation and encouraging signs from ministers. In England, there is one “official” population of beavers, on the river Otter, in Devon, where escapees were given permission to stay. Elsewhere, wild populations are caught in a “limbo”.\n",

Lily Stroud from Newcastle said she \"took a risk \" by reserving rooms on two weekends at a Maldron Hotel in Manchester in July 2025 after speculation about the band's return. But the hotel chain cancelled her bookings after the tour announcement due to a \"technical error\", with the same rooms now listed as unavailable.

Rumours had been swirling the day before, after the band posted an image of a date that read \"27.08.24\" on their social media platforms. Oasis are set to play at Heaton Park in Manchester on 11, 12 ,19 and 20 July. The hotel said a technical error with bookings made on Monday and Tuesday led to \"substantially more rooms booked\" than were available on the dates of the concerts. The same problem allowed \"a small number of customers\" to book rooms at a higher price later on Tuesday, he said, adding these bookings would also be cancelled. An apology has been issued by the hotel, which is not taking any new reservations while it investigates the problem. It comes after Mr Lord called on the hotel to \"do the right thing\" after he received numerous complaints. Mr Lord said he had been contacted by several disgruntled customers on X, some of whom said their bookings had been cancelled by the hotel and were \"now back up for three times the price\". As of Wednesday, the prices for some Manchester hotels for the weekends of the Oasis gigs were about double those of the weeks before and afterwards. One hotel's website listed rooms for about £750 on the weekends of the Heaton Park shows, compared to about £350 on the nearest other weekends.

The hotel then emailed her and scores of other fans after the tour was announced to say the bookings had been unsuccessful. The 26-year-old said she rang the Maldron Hotel directly, and was told initially her booking was still on the system, before later being told it could not be found. \"We were kind of expecting it,\" she said, adding she was \"frustrated\" as \"it's stressful enough as it is thinking, 'are you going to get tickets'\".

It’s daft,\" she said. “People are disgruntled that they’ve done this early. It’s not fair.”\n",

However at 8.15pm on Tuesday, he received an email from the hotel which said a technical error meant his booking had not been successful. Mr O'Gorman, from County Meath, Ireland, said: \"The minute I saw that email from the hotel, I opened up Booking.com and the exact same room I booked is now around £350, so there's no technical error there.\" He said he is \"limbo\", adding: \"Realistically, I'll probably be priced out of that date so I can't go for that ticket as I will also need to book a flight. \"I feel really frustrated and it feels so unfair as I tried to be ahead of the curve.

Manchester City councillor Pat Karney told BBC Radio Manchester staff at the council would investigate what had happened. \"If this is the case then they have let themselves down and they've let Manchester down,\" he said. \"We’re not daft, we know prices are going to be high, so long as people in hotels are fair about it. \"There’s no justification for ripping off people.\" Dan, aged 37, from Hull, said he had booked at the Hazeldean Hotel in Salford, which had offered free cancellation ahead of the announcement, but he has now been told he must pay in full by Friday, the day before Oasis tickets go on sale. “How is this fair and how am I supposed to pay this when I don't know if I'll get tickets? “I'm sure they're doing this just so they can cancel and then put on for a higher price.\" The Hazeldean Hotel has been contacted for comment.

            "\n",
            "Aeroplane passengers should be restricted to two drinks at airports, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. Mr O'Leary said introducing alcohol limits at airports would help tackle a rise in disorder on flights. Violent outbursts are occurring weekly due to alcohol, he said, especially when it is mixed with other substances. \"We don't want to begrudge people having a drink,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. \"But we don't allow people to drink-drive, yet we keep putting them up in aircraft at 33,000ft.\"\n",

            "'Aggressive behaviour'\n",
            "\n",
            "Crew members and other passengers have become targets, according to Mr O'Leary. Delays add to the problem, with longer drinking times at airports. \"In the old days, people who drank too much would eventually fall over or fall asleep. But now those passengers are also on tablets and powder,\" he added. \"It's the mix. You get much more aggressive behaviour that becomes very difficult to manage.\" Mr O'Leary said it was difficult for airlines to identify inebriated people at the gate, especially when they boarded in a group. \"As long as they can stand up and shuffle they will get through. Then when the plane takes off, we see the misbehaviour,\" he said. Ryanair staff search bags for alcohol before passengers board flights to Ibiza, one of the worst-affected \"party destinations\". Other challenging destinations include some of the Greek islands.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Unacceptable'\n",
            "\n",
            "An AirportsUK spokesperson said that disruptive behaviour, whether due to alcohol or other causes, \"is unacceptable and could lead to substantial penalties\". These penalties include fines, boarding being refused, or up to two years in jail. The spokesperson added that airports have \"a wide range of measures in place to monitor and tackle disruptive behaviour and ensure everyone's safety\". \"Airports are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable travel experience for all passengers and we're pleased that the vast majority of travellers continue to enjoy their journeys responsibly,\" they said.\n",

SSE says its 103-turbine project, known as Viking, can generate 443 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes. Shetland is the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the turbines not to be spinning. Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told BBC News a \"significant acceleration\" in renewable energy infrastructure is now urgently needed if the UK is to meet its climate change targets. \"We need to do a lot more of these projects, a lot more offshore wind projects as well, to make sure that we can decarbonise the energy system,\" he said.\n",

The company said it has invested more than £1bn in the windfarm and cable projects, and plans to plough another £20bn into renewables by the end of the decade. Mr Phillips-Davies said that would amount to \"the biggest construction that we've seen since the Second World War.\" \"Shetland's got a great wind resource.

            "The UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Viking was \"a crucial part\" of reducing the UK's reliance on \"volatile fossil fuel markets, boosting our energy independence and protecting consumers.\" The Labour government has set a target for 100% of the UK's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030, phasing out gas-fired power stations. Ministers have promised to accelerate the development of wind, hydrogen and carbon capture projects by investing £8.3bn over five years in a publicly-owned power company called Great British Energy. The Conservatives have previously said that GB Energy is a \"financial black hole\" which will funnel taxpayers' money \"into reducing risk for multi-million pound energy companies.\" Mr Miliband also claims the Viking project will ensure \"hundreds of thousands of homes in the Shetlands and right across the country will benefit from cheap, homegrown energy,\" but that is hotly contested on the archipelago.\n",

            "\n",
            "Moraig Lyall, chair of the environment and transport committee of Shetland Islands Council, said annual household bills in the islands were often more than double the UK average of £1,700 and showed no sign of falling as a result of hosting Viking. \"People look out their windows now, they see all these turbines that are generating lots and lots of energy, but they're not seeing the benefit here. \"They're still sitting in their homes having to decide, can I afford to put on my heating, and so people are justifiably angry about that,\" she said, adding that islanders were also worried about Viking's impact on the landscape; the peat bog environment on which it was built; and tourism.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is concern on the mainland too, where some communities are objecting to plans by SSE and others to erect large pylons to transmit electricity from new renewable projects to cities and towns throughout Scotland, England and Wales. \"Somebody needs to police the line between net zero ideology and rampant commercial opportunism,\" said Kate Matthews of Save Our Mearns, a group campaigning against SSE's plans to install 37- 44 miles (60-70km) of new pylons from Kintore in Aberdeenshire to Tealing in Angus. \"Angus and Aberdeenshire are looking at 10 to 20 years of industrialisation, so constant building, constant applications, thousands of acres of battery energy storage, thousands of acres of solar turbine hydrogen plants,\" said Ms Matthews. \"We'll be paying the price for generations. It will be unrecognisable,\" she added. Ms Matthews said \"the rest of the UK doesn't know what's coming,\" with plans for new pylons in Essex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, the Lake District, parts of Wales, and elsewhere.\n",

            "\n",
            "Ministers have also pledged to reform planning laws to make it easier and quicker for big projects to gain consent. Mr Phillips-Davies of SSE said that was vital, pointing out that it took 20 years for Viking to go from inception to blades turning, 16 years of which were on paper. He is calling for both the UK and Scottish governments to streamline and accelerate their planning processes so projects can be approved or rejected within 12 months. He points out that Berwick Bank in the outer Firth of Forth, which would be the world's largest offshore windfarm, has been waiting for consent from the Scottish government for nearly two years.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's not just renewable energy companies which have worries about the pace of the transition from fossil fuels to greener sources of power. In Aberdeen, the home of the UK oil and gas industry, there are concerns that the UK government is putting jobs at risk. “This is already a sector which is paying three times the tax of the wider economy,” says David Whitehouse of the industry body, Offshore Energies UK, formerly Oil & Gas UK. Producers currently pay a tax rate of 78%, including a windfall tax brought in after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a spike in the oil price. Mr Whitehouse says he is also concerned about the removal of tax breaks for investment. He warns of a potential \"shutdown of investment\" which he says could have consequences for thousands of jobs and implications for \"the very supply chain that we need to deliver a successful domestic home-grown energy transition\".\n",
